     <p>why we should save sharks<br>
        Sharks play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of ocean ecosystems.<br>As apex predators, they regulate the populations of other marine species, preventing any single group from becoming too dominant and helping to maintain a healthy food web.<br> Without sharks, ecosystems can quickly become unbalanced, leading to declines in important species like fish and coral reefs.<br> Their presence keeps prey populations healthy by removing the sick and weak, supporting overall biodiversity in the ocean.<br> Unfortunately, people hurt sharks in several harmful ways, often without realizing the full impact.<br>One major threat is shark finning, where sharks are caught, their fins are cut off—often while they're still alive—and the rest of the body is thrown back into the ocean to die.<br> Millions of sharks are killed this way each year, mainly to supply demand for shark fin soup.<br> Sharks are also harmed by overfishing and getting accidentally caught as bycatch in nets meant for other fish.<br> Pollution, especially plastic waste and chemicals, further damages their habitats. <br>These human actions are pushing many shark species toward extinction, disrupting the ocean’s natural balance.<br>
Additionally, saving sharks is essential for the health of our planet and even our economies. <br>Many coastal communities rely on healthy oceans for tourism, and shark diving generates millions of dollars annually worldwide.<br> However, shark populations are declining rapidly due to overfishing, bycatch, and the shark fin trade.<br> Protecting sharks through conservation efforts, sustainable fishing practices, and education can help preserve not only these ancient creatures but also the marine environments and economies that depend on them.<br> By understanding the vital role sharks play and the threats they face, we can take action to ensure they survive for future generations.
